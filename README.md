Note: Please disregard the Arduino Uno,we will be using ESP32

### How to update your local project from GitHub repository

1. Open command prompt

2. Type the following in your command prompt
```
cd c:\git-repo\smart-circuit-breaker
```

3. Check if you have local changes in your project by typing the below command
```
git status
```
If there are any local changes then we need to delete it by executing the below command
```
git checkout .
```
Run `git status` again to verify that it is clean

4. Get the latest changes from GitHub by running the following command
```
git pull
```

### How to open project in VSCode
1. Open command prompt
2. Change the directory to your project folder
```
cd c:\git-repo\smart-circuit-breaker
code .
```
This should open your project in VSCode


### Testing Steps
#### Test the ESP32
1. Run and check the output of test_blink_esp32_led.cpp

Expected Output:
The Internal LED of the ESP32 should blink continuously

#### Test the TFT
1. Run and check the output of test_hello_world_tft.cpp

Expected Output:
The TFT should display Hello from Smart Circuit Breaker

#### Test the PZEM
1. Run and check the output of test_read_pzem_async.cpp

Expected Output:
We should see the PZEM reading

#### Test the SSR being driven by the transistor
1. Run and check the output of test_drive_transistor.cpp

Expected Output:
We should see the SSR blinking every 5 seconds


#### Setup the SSR wiring from the Load Side to the power side
Note: Adjust and double check for shorting


#### Test the blynk connection
1. Run and check the output of test_main.cpp

Expected Output:
Open the BLYNK Cloud Application https://blynk.cloud/dashboard and login using the credentials given by Ram
Click the Smart Circuit Breaker and verify that the output of the Line is being displayed (Current and Voltage)

#### Validate the Blynk Connection
You should see the following in your terminal serial monitor when you are able to connect to Blynk Server
```
--- Terminal on COM5 | 115200 8-N-1
--- Available filters and text transformations: colorize, debug, default, direct, esp32_exception_decoder, hexlify, log2file, nocontrol, printable, send_on_enter, time
--- More details at https://bit.ly/pio-monitor-filters
--- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H
